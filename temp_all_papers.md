# NEW PAPER BATCH PAPERS (53 papers)

## 28. **V-JEPA: Revisiting Feature Prediction for Learning Visual Representations from Video**
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08471
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/facebookresearch/jepa
- **Project Page**: https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-yann-lecun-ai-model-video-joint-embedding-predictive-architecture/
- **Abstract**: This paper explores feature prediction as a stand-alone objective for unsupervised learning from video and introduces V-JEPA, a collection of vision models trained solely using a feature prediction objective, without the use of pretrained image encoders, text, negative examples, reconstruction, or other sources of supervision. We train on 2 million videos and study how the size of the model and the amount of data affect performance on downstream tasks. We find that feature prediction can lead to versatile visual representations that perform well across downstream image and video tasks without adaption of the model's weights; i.e., using a frozen backbone. The largest model (ViT-H/16) achieves 81.9% on Kinetics-400, 72.2% on Something-Something-v2, and 77.9% on ImageNet1K.

## 29. **V-JEPA 2: Self-Supervised Video Models Enable Understanding, Prediction and Planning**
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09985
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/facebookresearch/vjepa2
- **Project Page**: https://ai.meta.com/vjepa/
- **Abstract**: We present V-JEPA 2, an action-free joint-embedding-predictive architecture pre-trained on a video and image dataset comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7 recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models. On video question-answering at 8B parameter scale, V-JEPA 2 achieves 84.0 on PerceptionTest and 76.9 on TempCompass. We also present V-JEPA 2-AC, a latent action-conditioned world model post-trained using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the Droid dataset. V-JEPA 2-AC was deployed zero-shot on Franka arms in two different labs and enabled picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals. This was achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these environments, and without any task-specific training or reward.

## 30. **VideoMAE: Masked Autoencoders are Data-Efficient Learners for Self-Supervised Video Pre-Training**
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12602
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/MCG-NJU/VideoMAE
- **Abstract**: Pre-training video transformers on extra large-scale datasets is generally required to achieve premier performance on relatively small datasets. In this paper, we show that video masked autoencoders (VideoMAE) are data-efficient learners for self-supervised video pre-training (SSVP). We are inspired by the recent ImageMAE and propose customized video tube masking and reconstruction. Specifically, we present the following findings: (1) An extremely high proportion of masking ratio (i.e., 90% to 95%) still yields favorable performance of VideoMAE. The temporally redundant video content enables higher masking ratio than in images. (2) VideoMAE achieves impressive results on very small datasets (i.e., around 3k-4k videos) without using any extra data. This suggests that VideoMAE could be a new paradigm for data-efficient video pre-training. (3) VideoMAE shows that data quality is more important than data quantity for SSVP. Domain-specific video data yields better performance than general-purpose video data. VideoMAE can achieve 87.4% on Kinetics-400, 75.4% on Something-Something V2, 91.3% on UCF101, and 62.6% on HMDB51 without using any extra data.

## 31. **VideoMAE V2: Scaling Video Masked Autoencoders with Dual Masking**
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16727
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/VideoMAEv2
- **Project Page**: https://huggingface.co/collections/OpenGVLab/videomae-v2-678631493ab2f0c4642d842d
- **Abstract**: This paper shows that video masked autoencoder (VideoMAE) is a scalable and general self-supervised pre-trainer for building video foundation models. We present a dual masking strategy for efficient pre-training, with an encoder operating on a subset of video tokens and a decoder processing another subset of video tokens. We scaled the pre-training of VideoMAE V2 to billion-level ViT-g model with million-level data size, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Kinetics (90.0% on K400) and Something-Something (68.7% on V1). The pre-trained models are publicly available.

## 32. **OmniMAE: Single Model Masked Pretraining on Images and Videos**
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08356
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/facebookresearch/omnivore
- **Project Page**: https://facebookresearch.github.io/omnivore/
- **Abstract**: Transformer-based architectures have become competitive across a variety of visual domains, most notably images and videos. While prior work studies these modalities in isolation, having a common architecture suggests that one can train a single unified model for multiple visual modalities. Prior attempts at unified modeling typically use architectures tailored for vision tasks, or obtain worse performance compared to single modality models. In this work, we show that masked autoencoding can be used to train a simple Vision Transformer on images and videos, without requiring any labeled data. This single model learns visual representations that are comparable to or better than single-modality representations on both image and video benchmarks, while using a much simpler architecture. Furthermore, this model can be learned by dropping 90% of the image and 95% of the video patches, enabling extremely fast training of huge model architectures. In particular, we show that our single ViT-Huge model can be finetuned to achieve 86.6% on ImageNet and 75.5% on the challenging Something Something-v2 video benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art.

## 33. **CLIP-GS: CLIP-Informed Gaussian Splatting for Real-time and View-consistent 3D Semantic Understanding**
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14249
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/gbliao/CLIP-GS
- **Project Page**: https://gbliao.github.io/CLIP-GS.github.io/
- **Abstract**: The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) exhibits high-quality and real-time synthesis of novel views in 3D scenes. Currently, it primarily focuses on geometry and appearance modeling, while lacking the semantic understanding of scenes. To bridge this gap, we present CLIP-GS, which integrates semantics from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) into Gaussian Splatting to efficiently comprehend 3D environments without annotated semantic data. In specific, rather than straightforwardly learning and rendering high-dimensional semantic features of 3D Gaussians, which significantly diminishes the efficiency, we propose a Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) approach. SAC exploits the inherent unified semantics within objects to learn compact yet effective semantic representations of 3D Gaussians, enabling highly efficient rendering (>100 FPS). Additionally, to address the semantic ambiguity, we introduce 3DCS which imposes cross-view semantic consistency constraints by leveraging refined, self-predicted pseudo-labels derived from the trained 3D Gaussian model, thereby enhancing precise and view-consistent segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of 17.29% and 20.81% in mIoU metric on Replica and ScanNet datasets, respectively, while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior performance even with sparse input data, verifying the robustness of our method.

## 34. **DOF-GS: Adjustable Depth-of-Field 3D Gaussian Splatting for Post-Capture Refocusing, Defocus Rendering and Blur Removal**
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17351
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/leoShen917/DoF-Gaussian
- **Project Page**: https://dof-gaussian.github.io/
- **Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques have recently enabled high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. These approaches, however, are limited by the pinhole camera model and lack effective modeling of defocus effects. Departing from this, we introduce DOF-GS--a new 3DGS-based framework with a finite-aperture camera model and explicit, differentiable defocus rendering, enabling it to function as a post-capture control tool. By training with multi-view images with moderate defocus blur, DOF-GS learns inherent camera characteristics and reconstructs sharp details of the underlying scene, particularly, enabling rendering of varying DOF effects through on-demand aperture and focal distance control, post-capture and optimization. Additionally, our framework extracts circle-of-confusion cues during optimization to identify in-focus regions in input views, enhancing the reconstructed 3D scene details.

## 35. **LP-3DGS: Learning to Prune 3D Gaussian Splatting**
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18784
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/ASU-ESIC-FAN-Lab/LP-3DGS
- **Project Page**: https://paperswithcode.com/paper/lp-3dgs-learning-to-prune-3d-gaussian
- **Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the mainstream methodologies for novel view synthesis (NVS) due to its high quality and fast rendering speed. However, as a point-based scene representation, 3DGS potentially generates a large number of Gaussians to fit the scene, leading to high memory usage. Improvements that have been proposed require either an empirical and preset pruning ratio or importance score threshold to prune the point cloud. Such hyperparameter requires multiple rounds of training to optimize and achieve the maximum pruning ratio, while maintaining the rendering quality for each scene. In this work, we propose learning-to-prune 3DGS (LP-3DGS), where a trainable binary mask is applied to the importance score that can find optimal pruning ratio automatically. Instead of using the traditional straight-through estimator (STE) method to approximate the binary mask gradient, we redesign the masking function to leverage the Gumbel-Sigmoid method, making it differentiable and compatible with the existing training process of 3DGS. Extensive experiments have shown that LP-3DGS consistently produces a good balance that is both efficient and high quality.
