# Progress Tracking: Paper Unification Project

## Phase 0: Planning & Setup ✅
- [x] Explored current structure (initial_dump/ + new_paper_batch/)
- [x] Created goal.md with project objectives
- [x] Created progress.md for tracking
- [ ] Create detailed planning file with sharding strategy

## Phase 1: Data Consolidation 🔄
- [ ] Create temp:all_papers.md with unified paper list
- [ ] Identify and mark duplicate papers
- [ ] Standardize paper entry formats
- [ ] Extract categorization tags

## Phase 2: Paper Index Generation 📝
- [ ] Create Final_batch/ directory
- [ ] Generate standardized paper_index_{n}.md files
- [ ] Implement consistent cross-referencing
- [ ] Validate all external links

## Phase 3: Deep Review Generation 📚
- [ ] Port existing deep reviews from initial_dump/
- [ ] Generate new deep reviews for papers lacking them
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting across all reviews
- [ ] Implement proper section anchoring

## Phase 4: Table of Contents Assembly 📋
- [ ] Analyze all papers for category classification
- [ ] Generate hierarchical category structure
- [ ] Create master Table_Of_Contents.md
- [ ] Validate all cross-references and links

## Current Status
**Phase**: 0 (Planning & Setup)  
**Progress**: 60% of Phase 0 complete  
**Next Action**: Create detailed planning file with sharding strategy

## Paper Count Summary
- **Initial Dump**: ~50+ Gaussian Splatting papers (estimated from sample)
- **New Paper Batch**: ~100+ papers across 5 files (estimated)
- **Total Estimated**: 150+ papers requiring unification

## Quality Checks Required
- [ ] All project page links functional
- [ ] All arXiv links functional  
- [ ] No duplicate papers in final output
- [ ] Consistent formatting across all files
- [ ] Proper anchor linking between files
