## Paper 23: BARD-GS - Motion Blur-Aware Dynamic Scene Reconstruction

**Summary**: BARD-GS introduces a two-stage pipeline for dynamic scene reconstruction that explicitly handles motion blur by decomposing it into camera motion and object motion components, enabling high-quality reconstruction from blurry video inputs using 3D Gaussian Splatting.

**Key Improvements**:
1. Motion blur handling: First method to explicitly model both camera and object blur
2. Reconstruction quality: Significantly improved dynamic region reconstruction
3. Robustness: Handles imprecise camera poses better than existing methods
4. Real-world dataset: Created paired blurry/sharp video dataset for evaluation
5. Two-stage optimization: Separates camera and object motion modeling

**How It Works**:
```
Stage 1: Camera Motion Deblurring
- Learn camera poses during exposure time
- Model camera trajectory as continuous function
- Optimize camera parameters with blur kernel

Stage 2: Object Motion Deblurring  
- Initialize dynamic Gaussians using DepthAnything depth maps
- Apply deformation field D(p,t) to model Gaussian trajectories
- Gaussian position: x'(t) = x + D(x,t)
- Blur formulation: I_blur = ∫(t_start to t_end) render(G(t)) dt

Optimization:
L_total = L_photometric + λ_depth * L_depth + λ_reg * L_regularization
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Depth initialization: DepthAnything v2 for robust depth priors
- Deformation network: MLP with positional encoding
- Time sampling: 5-7 samples per exposure interval
- Regularization weight: λ_depth = 0.1, λ_reg = 0.01
- Gaussian pruning threshold: opacity < 0.005

**Integration with Spacetime Gaussians**:
- Modify `GaussianModel` to include blur kernel parameters
- Add `DeformationField` module for trajectory modeling
- Update rendering to accumulate multiple time samples
- Integration points:
  - `scene/gaussian_model.py`: Add blur parameters
  - `utils/renderer.py`: Implement multi-sample rendering
  - `train.py`: Two-stage training loop

**Speed/Memory Tradeoffs**:
- Training time impact: +2-3x slower due to multi-sample rendering
- Rendering speed impact: 5-7x slower (multiple samples per frame)
- Memory requirements: +30% for deformation network
- Quality vs speed: Can reduce samples from 7 to 3 for 2x speedup

## Paper 24: vkraygs - Hardware-Rasterized Ray-Based Gaussian Splatting

**Summary**: vkraygs implements a Vulkan-based hardware-accelerated renderer for Gaussian Splatting that uses ray-based techniques instead of traditional rasterization, enabling efficient rendering of Gaussian Opacity Fields.

**Key Improvements**:
1. Hardware acceleration: Full GPU pipeline using Vulkan
2. Ray-based approach: More accurate rendering than rasterization
3. GOF compatibility: Native support for Gaussian Opacity Fields
4. Interactive performance: Real-time navigation and rendering
5. MIP-aware rendering: Adaptive scale/opacity based on MIP level

**How It Works**:
```
Ray Generation:
- Generate rays from camera through each pixel
- Ray equation: r(t) = o + td

Gaussian Intersection:
- For each ray, find intersecting Gaussians
- Evaluate Gaussian contribution along ray:
  G(r(t)) = opacity * exp(-0.5 * (r(t) - μ)ᵀ Σ⁻¹ (r(t) - μ))

Volume Rendering:
- Accumulate color along ray:
  C = Σᵢ αᵢ * cᵢ * Πⱼ<ᵢ (1 - αⱼ)
  
MIP Adaptation:
- Scale adjustment: scale' = scale * (1 + mip_bias * mip_level)
- Opacity adjustment: opacity' = opacity * exp(-mip_level * 0.5)
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Vulkan SDK: Version 1.2+ required
- Shader pipeline: Compute shaders for ray generation and intersection
- Acceleration structure: BVH for Gaussian culling
- Buffer layout: Interleaved position-scale-rotation-opacity
- MIP bias: Default 0.0 for GOF models

**Integration with Spacetime Gaussians**:
- Replace CUDA rasterizer with Vulkan ray tracer
- Modify `submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization`:
  - Add `vulkan_rasterizer.cpp`
  - Implement ray-based forward/backward pass
- Update `utils/renderer.py` to use Vulkan backend
- Add BVH construction for acceleration

**Speed/Memory Tradeoffs**:
- Training time impact: Not applicable (viewer only)
- Rendering speed: 60-120 FPS at 1080p (hardware dependent)
- Memory requirements: +200MB for Vulkan buffers
- Quality vs speed: Ray count adjustable (256-1024 rays/pixel)

## Paper 26: DASS - Dynamic Spatial Streaming for 3D Gaussian Splatting

**Summary**: DASS introduces a three-stage pipeline for iterative streamable 4D reconstruction that intelligently handles dynamic and static scene elements separately, achieving 20% faster on-the-fly training while maintaining superior quality.

**Key Improvements**:
1. Training speed: 20% improvement in on-the-fly training
2. Streaming capability: Per-frame progressive reconstruction
3. Adaptive inheritance: Intelligent Gaussian preservation
4. Dynamic-static separation: Specialized handling for each type
5. Error-guided densification: Adaptive quality improvement

**How It Works**:
```
Stage 1: Selective Inheritance
- Preserve Gaussians from frame t-1 based on:
  confidence(G) = opacity * (1 - velocity_magnitude)
- Inherit if confidence > θ_inherit (default 0.7)

Stage 2: Dynamics-Aware Shift
- Classify Gaussians as static/dynamic:
  is_dynamic = ||∇_pos L|| > θ_dynamic
- Static: Update only appearance
- Dynamic: Update position + appearance
  
Stage 3: Error-Guided Densification
- Detect weak areas using:
  error_map = positional_gradient + appearance_distortion
- Densify where error > θ_densify
- Clone/split based on gradient magnitude

Loss Function:
L = L_rgb + λ_pos * L_position + λ_temp * L_temporal
L_temporal = ||G_t - warp(G_{t-1})||²
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Inheritance threshold: θ_inherit = 0.7
- Dynamic threshold: θ_dynamic = 0.01
- Densification threshold: θ_densify = 0.002
- Temporal weight: λ_temp = 0.1
- Lightweight parameters: Only optimize subset per frame
- Buffer size: Keep 3 frames in memory

**Integration with Spacetime Gaussians**:
- Modify `scene/gaussian_model.py`:
  - Add `confidence` and `is_dynamic` attributes
  - Implement selective inheritance logic
- Update `train.py`:
  - Three-stage training loop
  - Per-frame parameter selection
- Add `utils/streaming.py`:
  - Frame buffer management
  - Temporal warping functions

**Speed/Memory Tradeoffs**:
- Training time: 20% faster than baseline
- Rendering speed: No impact (same as 3DGS)
- Memory: +3 frames buffer (~300MB at 100k Gaussians)
- Quality vs speed: Can skip stages for 40% speedup

## Paper 27: 4D-LangSplat - Learning 4D Language Fields

**Summary**: 4D-LangSplat introduces a multimodal approach that learns dynamic semantic features directly from MLLM-generated video captions, enabling time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries on dynamic 3D scenes with accurate tracking of semantic changes.

**Key Improvements**:
1. Dynamic semantics: Captures time-varying semantic features
2. MLLM integration: Direct learning from language models
3. Object-wise features: Pixel-aligned, object-specific embeddings
4. Temporal awareness: Tracks gradual semantic changes
5. Open-vocabulary: Supports arbitrary text queries

**How It Works**:
```
Video Caption Generation:
- Input: Video frames + object masks
- MLLM prompt: "Describe object changes over time"
- Output: Object-wise temporal descriptions

Feature Learning:
- Text encoder: T(caption) → embedding ∈ R^d
- Feature field: F(x,t) = MLP(γ(x,t))
- Alignment loss: L_align = ||F(x,t) - T(caption)||²

Status Deformation Network:
- Input: position x, time t, object_id
- Hidden: h = ReLU(W₁[γ(x), γ(t), object_id])
- Output: Δfeature = W₂(h)
- Dynamic feature: F'(x,t) = F(x,0) + Δfeature

Query Processing:
- Text query → embedding
- Similarity: sim(x,t) = F(x,t) · query_embedding
- Relevance map: softmax(sim / temperature)
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Text encoder: Sentence-BERT (384-dim embeddings)
- MLLM: GPT-4V or similar for caption generation
- Feature dimension: d = 384
- MLP layers: [256, 512, 256, 384]
- Temperature: τ = 0.07
- Object tracking: SAM2 for masks

**Integration with Spacetime Gaussians**:

  - Add `object_id` for tracking
- Modify `scene/gaussian_model.py`:
  - Include semantic feature in state
  - Add deformation network module
- Update rendering:
  - Output semantic features alongside RGB
  - Implement feature splatting
- Add `models/language_field.py`:
  - MLLM interface
  - Text encoding pipeline

**Speed/Memory Tradeoffs**:
- Training time: +4-5 hours for MLLM processing
- Rendering speed: 10% slower (extra feature splatting)
- Memory: +1.5GB for semantic features (100k Gaussians)
- Quality vs speed: Can reduce feature dim to 128 for 3x speedup
