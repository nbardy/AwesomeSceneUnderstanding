# Deep Technical Reviews - 3D Gaussian Splatting & Core Techniques

## Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF)

### Summary
GOF introduces learnable opacity fields that separate geometry from appearance by treating opacity as a continuous volumetric function rather than per-Gaussian attributes. The method enables direct geometry extraction from 3D Gaussians through levelset identification and uses ray-tracing-based volume rendering with Marching Tetrahedra for surface reconstruction.

### Key Improvements
1. **Geometry Quality**: Baseline 3DGS (explicit disconnected) → GOF (continuous surfaces)
2. **Surface Extraction**: Post-processing required → Direct levelset extraction
3. **Normal Estimation**: Per-Gaussian normals → Ray-Gaussian intersection plane normals
4. **Scene Adaptability**: Fixed resolution → Adaptive tetrahedral grids
5. **Reconstruction Scope**: Bounded scenes → Unbounded scene support

### How It Works

**Core Algorithm**
```python
def gaussian_opacity_field(gaussians, ray):
    """
    Compute opacity field for ray-gaussian intersection
    Mathematical formulation: α(x) = Σ_i w_i * G_i(x)
    Key difference from baseline: Continuous opacity field vs discrete opacities
    """
    # Ray-Gaussian intersection
    intersection_points = []
    for gaussian in gaussians:
        t = compute_ray_gaussian_intersection(ray, gaussian)
        if t > 0:
            point = ray.origin + t * ray.direction
            intersection_points.append((point, gaussian))
    
    # Compute opacity field value
    opacity = 0
    for point, gaussian in intersection_points:
        # Weight based on Gaussian contribution
        weight = gaussian.compute_weight(point)
        opacity += weight * gaussian.opacity
    
    return opacity

def extract_surface_levelset(opacity_field, threshold=0.5):
    """
    Extract surface as levelset of opacity field
    """
    # Marching Tetrahedra on adaptive grid
    tetra_grid = create_adaptive_tetrahedral_grid(opacity_field)
    vertices, faces = marching_tetrahedra(tetra_grid, threshold)
    
    # Compute normals from ray-Gaussian intersection
    normals = []
    for vertex in vertices:
        normal = compute_intersection_plane_normal(vertex)
        normals.append(normal)
    
    return vertices, faces, normals
```

**Mathematical Foundation**
- Opacity field: α(x) = Σ_i w_i * G_i(x) where w_i are learnable weights
- Surface definition: S = {x | α(x) = τ} where τ is the levelset threshold
- Normal approximation: n = normalize(∇α(x)) via ray-intersection geometry

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Initialize**: Standard 3DGS with additional opacity field parameters
2. **Ray Tracing**: Compute ray-Gaussian intersections for each pixel
3. **Opacity Accumulation**: Aggregate Gaussian contributions into continuous field
4. **Surface Extraction**: Apply Marching Tetrahedra on adaptive grid at τ=0.5
5. **Normal Computation**: Derive from ray-Gaussian intersection planes

### Implementation Details
- Architecture: Standard 3DGS backbone + opacity field network
- Grid Resolution: Adaptive based on scene complexity
- Dependencies: PyTorch, CUDA-based rasterization
- Integration: Modifies Gaussian rendering pipeline
- Post-processing: None required for geometry extraction

### Integration Notes
```python
# Modify standard 3DGS rendering
# In gaussian_renderer.py:
# - render_gaussians(scene, camera)
# + render_with_opacity_field(scene, camera, opacity_network)

# Add opacity field computation
def render_with_opacity_field(scene, camera, opacity_network):
    rays = generate_camera_rays(camera)
    for ray in rays:
        opacity = gaussian_opacity_field(scene.gaussians, ray)
        # Continue standard rendering with opacity field
```

### Speed/Memory Tradeoffs
- Training: Comparable to standard 3DGS (additional opacity network overhead)
- Inference: Surface extraction adds overhead vs pure rendering
- Memory: Additional storage for tetrahedral grid structure
- Quality: Improved geometry at cost of extraction time

## Mip-Splatting

### Summary
Mip-Splatting addresses aliasing artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting through a dual-filter approach combining 3D smoothing and 2D Mip filtering. The method achieves anti-aliased rendering by adapting Gaussian scales based on viewing distance and sampling rate, winning CVPR 2024 best paper award.

### Key Improvements
1. **Aliasing Reduction**: Severe artifacts → Clean multi-resolution rendering
2. **PSNR**: Baseline 3DGS → +1.5-2.0 dB improvement (typical)
3. **Training Stability**: Unstable at varying resolutions → Consistent across scales
4. **Zoom Robustness**: Quality degradation → Maintained quality at all distances
5. **Memory**: ~10-15% overhead for Mip filter pyramids

### How It Works

    """
    # 3D Smoothing Filter
    distance = np.linalg.norm(gaussian.position - camera.position)
    focal_length = camera.focal_length

    smoothing_factor = 0.3  # λ hyperparameter
    scale_adjustment = smoothing_factor * distance / focal_length

```

**Mathematical Foundation**
- 3D Filter: Σ'_3D = Σ_3D + λ²(d/f)²I where d=distance, f=focal length
- 2D Filter: Σ'_2D = max(Σ_2D, s²I) where s=pixel size
- Combined: Prevents aliasing while maintaining sharpness
- Complexity: O(n) additional operations per Gaussian

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Initialization**: Standard 3DGS initialization
2. **Distance Computation**: Calculate Gaussian-camera distances
3. **3D Smoothing**: Apply distance-based scale adjustment (λ=0.3)
4. **Projection**: Transform to 2D screen space
5. **2D Mip Filter**: Enforce minimum pixel coverage
6. **Rendering**: Standard alpha compositing with filtered Gaussians

### Implementation Details
- Architecture: Modified Gaussian rasterizer
- Hyperparameters: λ=0.3 (3D smoothing), min_pixel_size=1.0
- Training: 30k iterations, Adam optimizer, lr=1.6e-4
- Hardware: NVIDIA RTX 3090, 24GB VRAM
- Training time: ~30 minutes for Mip-NeRF360 scenes
- Critical: Filter application order matters (3D then 2D)

### Integration Notes
```python
# In diff3DGS/gaussian_renderer/__init__.py:
# Line 87 - Add Mip filtering
def render(viewpoint_camera, pc, pipe, bg_color, scaling_modifier=1.0):
    # Original code
    means3D = pc.get_xyz
    
    # + Add Mip-Splatting filters
    if pipe.enable_mip_splatting:
        # Compute camera distance for each Gaussian
        distances = torch.norm(means3D - viewpoint_camera.camera_center, dim=1)
        
        # Apply 3D smoothing filter
        scales = pc.get_scaling
        smoothing = 0.3 * distances / viewpoint_camera.FoVx  # λ * d/f
        scales = scales + smoothing.unsqueeze(1)
        
        # Rest of rendering pipeline continues...
```

### Speed/Memory Tradeoffs
- Training: +5-10% time due to filter computations
- Inference: 45 FPS → 42 FPS on RTX 3090 (7% reduction)
- Memory: +200MB for filter parameters and pyramids
- Quality settings: λ∈[0.1, 0.5] trades sharpness vs anti-aliasing
- Scaling: Linear with Gaussian count

### Summary
Wild Gaussians extends 3DGS to handle uncontrolled capture conditions by incorporating DINO-based appearance modeling and robust optimization. The method addresses challenges from varying lighting, transient objects, and inconsistent camera exposure through learned per-image appearance embeddings.

### Key Improvements

# Modify rendering call
# - rendered = render(camera, gaussians, pipeline, background)
# + rendered = wild_gaussian_rendering(
#     gaussians, camera, appearance_mlp, dino_features
# )
```

### Speed/Memory Tradeoffs
- Training: 2x slower due to DINO features + appearance MLP
- Inference: 45 FPS → 38 FPS (15% reduction)

## LP-3DGS: Learning to Prune 3D Gaussian Splatting

### Summary
LP-3DGS introduces learnable binary masks with Gumbel-Sigmoid approximation to automatically find optimal pruning ratios for 3D Gaussian Splatting. The method eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning by making the pruning process differentiable and learning scene-specific compression rates during training.

### Key Improvements

2. **Pruning Automation**: Manual ratio selection → Learned optimal ratio
3. **Training Efficiency**: Multiple rounds → Single training pass
4. **Quality Preservation**: Fixed ratio artifacts → Adaptive quality-aware pruning
5. **Integration**: Complex pipeline → Drop-in replacement

**Mathematical Foundation**
- Sensitivity: s_i = log|H_i| where H_i = ∂²L/∂θ_i²

- Pruning criterion: Remove if s_i < τ_adaptive
- Multi-round: τ_r = quantile(s, (R-r)/R * ρ) where R=rounds, ρ=target

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Initial Training**: Complete standard 3DGS optimization
2. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Compute Hessian log-det for each Gaussian
3. **Round 1 Pruning**: Remove bottom 30% by sensitivity
4. **Refinement**: 1000 iterations to adapt remaining Gaussians
5. **Round 2 Pruning**: Remove another 30% of remaining
6. **Final Round**: Prune to reach 90% total reduction

### Implementation Details
- Hessian computation: Gauss-Newton approximation for speed
- Rounds: 3 (30% → 30% → 30% of remaining)
- Refinement iterations: 1000 between rounds
- Learning rate (refinement): 1.6e-5 (reduced from training)
- Memory overhead: O(9n) for Hessian elements
- GPU: RTX 4090 for large scenes (24GB VRAM)
- Computation time: ~5 minutes post-training

### Speed/Memory Tradeoffs
- Pruning overhead: 5 minutes post-training
- Memory reduction: 90% fewer Gaussians
- Rendering speedup: 3.56x average (3.1x-4.2x range)
- Quality impact: -1.2 dB PSNR average
- Foreground quality: Better preserved than uniform pruning
- Scalability: O(n) Hessian approximation vs O(n²) exact

**Mathematical Foundation**
- Frequency decomposition: I = Σ_f I_f where f are frequency bands
- Resolution scheduling: r(t) = r_min * (r_max/r_min)^(t/T)²
- Primitive budget: N(t) = N_max * (r(t)/r_max)²
- Loss weighting: L = Σ_f w_f(t) * ||I_f - Î_f||₁

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Initialize**: Low resolution (128x128), minimal Gaussians
2. **Frequency Analysis**: Decompose target images into frequency bands
3. **Resolution Ramp**: Exponentially increase from 128 to full resolution
4. **Primitive Sync**: Grow Gaussian count proportional to pixel count
5. **Adaptive Training**: Higher learning rates early, decay with resolution
6. **Final Refinement**: Last 10% iterations at full resolution

### Implementation Details
- Starting resolution: 128x128
- Final resolution: Dataset dependent (up to 1920x1080)
- Growth schedule: Quadratic (smooth acceleration)
- Iterations: 7000 total (vs 30k standard)
- Learning rate schedule: 1.6e-3 → 1.6e-5 (tied to resolution)
- Densification: Every 100 iterations, threshold scales with resolution
- Hardware: RTX 3090 (24GB) or RTX 4090 (24GB)

### Speed/Memory Tradeoffs

2. **Quality**: PSNR 26.28 → 27.28 on Rubble dataset
3. **Parallelism**: Single GPU → 16 GPU efficient scaling
4. **Batch Training**: Single view → Multiple views per iteration
5. **Communication**: Dense → Sparse all-to-all pattern

- Convergence: Same as single GPU with proper scaling

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Initialization**: Partition Gaussians spatially across GPUs
2. **Visibility Computation**: Each GPU determines visible subset
3. **Sparse Exchange**: Transfer only required Gaussians
4. **Parallel Rendering**: Each GPU renders assigned pixels
5. **Gradient Aggregation**: All-reduce with sqrt scaling
6. **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Redistribute every 1000 iterations

### Implementation Details
- GPUs: 1-16x NVIDIA A100 (40GB each)
- Communication: NCCL with custom sparse patterns
- Batch size scaling: 1 → 16 views per iteration
- Learning rate: 1.6e-4 * sqrt(batch_size)
- Densification: threshold / sqrt(batch_size)
- Rebalancing: Every 1000 iterations
- Framework: PyTorch with custom CUDA kernels

### Speed/Memory Tradeoffs
- Training throughput: ~Linear scaling up to 16 GPUs
- Memory per GPU: 40GB utilized (vs 24GB limit single GPU)

## CoCoGaussian: Circle of Confusion for Defocused Images

### Summary
CoCoGaussian extends 3DGS to handle defocus blur by modeling the Circle of Confusion (CoC) through physically-based optics. The method generates multiple Gaussians per point to capture CoC shape and introduces learnable scaling for handling reflective/refractive surfaces where depth is unreliable.

### Key Improvements
1. **Input Requirements**: Sharp images only → Handles defocused images
2. **Blur Modeling**: Ignored → Physically-based CoC simulation
3. **Surface Handling**: Fails on reflective → Learnable scaling adaptation
4. **Reconstruction**: Blurry results → Sharp 3D from defocused input
5. **Depth Estimation**: Required accurate → Robust to depth errors

**Mathematical Foundation**
- Thin lens model: 1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i
- CoC diameter: c = |A·f·(d-D)/(d·(D-f))|
- Energy conservation: Σ opacity_i = opacity_original
- Bokeh shape: Hexagonal sampling for realistic blur

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Initialize**: Standard 3DGS from SfM or random
2. **Depth Computation**: Calculate per-Gaussian camera distance
3. **CoC Calculation**: Apply thin lens equation with learnable aperture
4. **Gaussian Generation**: Create 7 sub-Gaussians in hexagonal pattern
5. **Opacity Distribution**: Divide original opacity among sub-Gaussians
6. **Rendering**: Standard rasterization with expanded Gaussian set

### Implementation Details
- Sub-Gaussians: 7 per original (hexagonal pattern)
- Aperture range: f/1.4 to f/16 (learnable)
- Focal distance: 0.5m to infinity (learnable)
- Scaling factor: 0.5 to 2.0 (handles depth errors)
- Memory overhead: 7x Gaussian count during rendering
- GPU: RTX 3090 or better (increased memory usage)
- Training: 30k iterations standard

### Integration Notes
```python
# Modify gaussian_renderer.py
def render(viewpoint_cam, pc, pipe, bg_color, enable_coco=True):
    if enable_coco:
        # Initialize learnable parameters
        if not hasattr(pipe, 'coco_params'):
            pipe.coco_params = {
                'aperture': nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(2.8)),
                'focal_distance': nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(2.0)),
                'scaling_factor': nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(1.0))
            }
        
        # Generate CoC Gaussians
        means3D = pc.get_xyz
        coc_means = []
        coc_opacities = []
        
        for i in range(len(means3D)):
            depth = (means3D[i] - viewpoint_cam.camera_center).norm()
            coc = circle_of_confusion_diameter(
                depth,
                pipe.coco_params['focal_distance'],
                pipe.coco_params['aperture'],
                viewpoint_cam.FoVx
            )
            
            # Generate sub-Gaussians...
            # (Implementation as shown above)
    
    # Continue with standard rendering
```

### Speed/Memory Tradeoffs
- Rendering: 7x more Gaussians processed (45 FPS → 15 FPS)
- Memory: 7x peak during rendering, 1x storage
- Quality: Handles defocus vs requires sharp images
- Training: Similar time, more complex optimization
- Inference: Can disable CoC for sharp rendering
